# CodeFX

🎹 Add satisfying **typing sound effects** to the Godot script editor.  
Every keystroke can produce a subtle click, clack, or thock — making your coding sessions more fun and immersive.  

---

## ✨ Features
- Per-key **typing sound effects** inside Godot’s built-in script editor.  
- Pitch and volume randomization for a more natural, mechanical feel.  
- Special sound variations for **Enter**, **Space**, and **Backspace** keys.  
- Lightweight and editor-only (does not affect your game).  

---

## 📦 Installation
1. Copy the `addons/CodeFX/` folder into your project.  
2. In Godot, go to **Project → Project Settings → Plugins**.  
3. Enable **CodeFX**.  
4. Start typing in the script editor and enjoy the clacks 🎶

## ⚙️ Settings (planned / optional)
- Settings can currently be adjusted directly in the CodeFXCore.gd script

---

## 📝 Notes
- CodeFX only affects the **editor**, not your exported games.  
- Works in **Godot 4.4+** ( not tested in other versions).  
- For best experience, keep the `.wav` files small and uncompressed for low latency.
